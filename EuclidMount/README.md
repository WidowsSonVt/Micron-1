# Euclid mount for Micron

## Attention: 
you can't use the same script as Klicky probe, to catch the Euclid probe, you need to approach the dock from the front and do it slow on the last
10-20mm down, don't let the magnets "bang" as you may break them.
To release the probe, you approach the dock from the side and release going forwards.
There is section in the Klicky macro for Euclid, woks w/o any issues.


All STL' on Printables, link in the STL folder.

Gantry dock mount is the same, but use the 1 or 2mm spacer included, probe dock and X carriage mount is new design.
Mostly done but still work in progress.

Screws to mount the Dock to the Gantry mount:
2x M3x6-10 dependend on spacers you use.
